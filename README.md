# Set Prediction without Imposing Structure as Conditional Density Estimation

PyTorch code of the experiments for Deep Energy-based Set Prediction (DESP) and some baselines.
We circumvent the requirement for assignment-based set losses (e.g. Hungarian loss) and gain several advantages.

For details see [Set Prediction without Imposing Structure as Conditional Density Estimation](https://github.com/davzha/DESP) by David Zhang, Gertjan Burghouts, and Cees Snoek.
