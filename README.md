# Set Prediction without Imposing Structure as Conditional Density Estimation

PyTorch code for the experiments of Deep Energy-based Set Prediction (DESP) and some baselines.
DESP circumvents the requirement for assignment-based set losses as training objectives (e.g. Hungarian loss) and gains several advantages thereby.
